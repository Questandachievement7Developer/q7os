an older-or the oldest-sibling, good luck!\n\nThough not many has an older or younger sibling, not even Katsuki, well now he has one, and that's you. Adopted by the Bakugo couple, you now start an exciting life with the explosive, ticking bomb as your older sibling. Find what trouble-or head aching-pranks, times and scenes you have with the Bakugo family.\n\nA/N: I haven't seen so much child reader x bnha. So I thought of making my own, I don't know if I'm gonna make it long, and I'm not gonna follow the plot maybe a few scenes and plots. But your the main character in this book. And if you want a one-shots with other bnha in the book or a separate one. There is gonna be a chapter in maybe every book I make from now on to where you deposit you requests, or private message if you want.","voteCount":24171,"readCount":509233,"user":{"name":"Shiyiku_Sprite12","avatar":"https://a.wattpad.com/useravatar/Shiyiku_Sprite12.128.150058.jpg","fullname":"ShiyikuSprite"},"url":"https://www.wattpad.com/story/129102510-katsuki%27s-new-sibling-life-boku-no-hero-academia-x","numParts":54,"rankings":[],"firstPartId":496296472,"tags":["anime","bakugo","bnha","bokunoheroacademia","childreader","fanfic","katsuki","random","readerxcharacter","wattys2018"],"category":6},{"id":"122113863","title":"Wrong Number ","cover":"https://a.wattpad.com/cover/122113863-256-k828390.jpg","description":"❝Hey, I just found a really cool way to kill someone.❞\n\n❝Cool, let's hear it.❞\n\nin which a girl accidentally dials a wrong number\n\nhighest ranking:\n#66 in short story / 15.12.17\n#18 in short story / 06.01.18","voteCount":4084,"readCount":69951,"user":{"name":"itsallyssax","avatar":"https://a.wattpad.com/useravatar/itsallyssax.128.905459.jpg","fullname":"Allyssa Bianca"},"url":"https://www.wattpad.com/story/122113863-wrong-number","numParts":28,"rankings":[],"firstPartId":467079849,"tags":["call","dialogue","funny","humor","humour","love","number","phone","phonecall","random","short","shortstory","story","strangers","wrong","wrongnumber"],"category":17},{"id":"81197683","title":"Yandere Boyfriend/Girlfriend Scenario","cover":"https://a.wattpad.com/cover/81197683-256-k137686.jpg","description":"||❝ Don't escape me, you're just wasting your time, because I will follow you wherever you go, even if that place is the deepest depth of hell. ❞|| \n      \n           。。。First of all, I won't do a chapter like Your First Date or Your First Kiss.

But fate has other things in store for her. An ancient evil is rising - and only Constantine may have the power needed to fight it.\n\nAlong with a brash warrior and a too-perceptive scholar, Constantine begins to unravel secrets of a prophecy foretelling the end of the world.

In her first year at Hogwarts she soon discovers her abilities are way out of control. Amelia goes to great lengths to keep her friends safe from herself. But the consequences are more severe than she can imagine. \n\nLoyalties will be tested, friendships will fall and through everything, we learn who we can truly trust. \n\nAmelia goes through life as a normal young witch starting at Hogwarts. But as time goes on she realizes just how abnormal she truly is. \n\nWill she be able to defeat her betrayers? The ones who would see her dead? Or will she meet the same fate as many before her? \n\n--------------\n\nREVIEWS FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE READ THIS STORY\n\n\"This book is terrifying and amazing and I literally love it!\"\n\n\"...this story is very unique.
