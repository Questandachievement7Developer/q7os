# Game Bot
### By Arda Mavi

Artificial intelligence learn playing any game with watching you.

## What is this?
- First: Run program and play any game little bit.
- Second: Run program and watch artificial intelligence's playing game.

## How it works?
When you run the training program, program start to listen your keyboard and mouse moving and save these.<br>
Artificial intelligence learn: When I push any button?<br/>
And you run the artificial intelligence, It play your game like you.

## But how it learn?
##### Magic (just joking)
With deep learning.<br/>
Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning with neural networks inspired by the structure of the brains artificial neural networks.

### Playing with Artificial Intelligence:
1. Open the game you want (If artificial intelligence trained).
2. Run `python3 ai.py` command in terminal.

### Creating Training Dataset:
1. Run `python3 create_dataset.py` command in terminal.
2. Play your want game.
3. Stop `create_dataset` program with `Cntrl-C` in terminal.

### Model Training:
`python3 train.py`

### Using TensorBoard:
`tensorboard --logdir=Data/Checkpoints/logs`

### Important Notes:
- Used Python Version: 3.6.0

- Install necessary modules with `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt` command.

## WINDOWS Installation:
- Install Python 3.6.0 : https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/
- Run CMD and Input Command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
