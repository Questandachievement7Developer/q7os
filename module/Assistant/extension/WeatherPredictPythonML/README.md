# WeatherPredictPythonML

This repo contains three Python Jupyter Notebooks for a tutorial series published on [Stackabuse](http://stackabuse.com/) demonstrating a reasonable process for conducting a machine learning / data analytics project from data collection, data cleaning, data exploration, model experimentation and, model evaluation.
