    <p>
        In the settings menu there is an option that allows the user to apply effects to
        all applications without the need to switch each one on individually. But there
        are cases where the user wants a specific application to be excluded from the
        "Enable All" functionality. This can be done by using a blacklist. Just add the
        application name exactly as it is shown in the "Applications" entry.
